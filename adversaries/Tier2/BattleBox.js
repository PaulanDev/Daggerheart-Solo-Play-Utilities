All targets within Close range must succeed on a Finesse Reaction Roll or mark 3 Stress. 5. Stunning Clap. The Box leaps and their sides clap, creating a small sonic boom. All targets within Very Close range must succeed on a Strength Reaction Roll or become Vulnerable until the cube is defeated. 6. Psionic Whine. The Box releases a cluster of mechanical bees whose buzz rattles mortal minds. All targets within Close range must succeed on a Presence Reaction Roll or take 2d4+9 direct magic damage.",
